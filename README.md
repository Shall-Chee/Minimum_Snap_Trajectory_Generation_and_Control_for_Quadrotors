# Minimum_Snap_Trajectory_Generation_and_Control_for_Quadrotors

Proposed a trajectory generator based on A*, D* and RRTs to fultill complex indoor flying tasks.
Developed a controller for following trajectories requiring large accelerations based on 3D positions and yaw angles analysis.
Demonstrated the robustness of the method applied to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second)
