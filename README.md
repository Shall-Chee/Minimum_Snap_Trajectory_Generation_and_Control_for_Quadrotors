# Minimum_Snap_Trajectory_Generation_and_Control_for_Quadrotors
• Generated minimum snap trajectory based on Dijkstra and A* waypoints for complex indoor flying tasks.

• Developed MPC and PID controller to follow obtained trajectories based on quadrotor dynamics analysis.

• Validated robustness of the approach by applying it to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second).
